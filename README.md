# drawbot

Drawbot will be using the raspberry pi to control an mbot to draw doodles. 

## Architecture

As of now Drawbot will use a raspberry pi running nodejs to create a web server providing a web application to draw with and control the mbot. The raspberry pi will not be directly controlling the mbot by communicating to the arduino onboard. 

Using mbot to draw on grid patterns 

mbot velocity at motorspeed of 100: 5.5 inches per second

mbot one inch increment : 192ms at speed 100
